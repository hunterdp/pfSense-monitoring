#  The following describes how to configure pfSense, esxi and other services to
#  send their syslogs to an ELK server instance that has already been setup. 
#  It assumes that you have ELK running on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS that is
#  frontended by NGINX proxy server.  This was derived from multiple sources and 
#  customized to work in my environment.  It should work with pfSense 2.3.x and
#  versions of ESXi 5.5 and above.  
#
#  NB: I should move this to a puppet script

#  Copy the logstash conf files to /etc/logstash/conf.d/
#    - Note that the files are concatenated together in lexical order.
#    - Model is xx-inputs.conf  --> defines the input channels for receiving information
#             xx-xxxxxx.conf  --> defines the filtering options for that log format
#             xx-outputs.conf --> defines the output options.
#  current ones are:
#    01-inputs.conf (ports 5000 -> syslog and pfsense defined)
#    10-syslog.conf (syslog filtering)
#    10-syslog-esxi.conf (esxi filtering, not VirtualCenter)
#    11-pfsense.conf (pfsense firewall events filtering)
#    30-outputs.conf (pipe it all to elasticsearch)

#  Copy the specific pfsense 2.3.x pattern file 
mkdir /etc/logstash/conf.d/patterns
cp pfsense2-3-1.grok /etc/logstash/conf.d/patterns/

#  Create geoid data (NB: Need to make this a cron job since the data changes)
cd /etc/logstash
